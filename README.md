# matset
Imagine one's only tool was a hammer....

This is an implementation of one of my favorite card games as a Matlab GUI. I know. I have a vague intention of re-implementing it in a more appropriate language at some time. In the past, I have also had other vague intentions, such as scoring or recording my timing/accuracy to make a medium-hard AI to play against. Currently it's just a functional implementation of the game (provided you have access to Matlab... doesn't work in Octave unfortunately). I made this game because I wasn't happy with the various online interpretations. This game plays exactly like a physical game of set - it goes until the deck is empty, doesn't repeat cards, you're not guaranteed a set in a given 4x4 deal, etc.

The Game of Set is owned by Set Enterprises and I am not intending to take anything away from them by making this game. If anyone ever finds this game and wants to play it, please make sure you have also purchased the physical version of the game. It is a ton of fun!

To run the game, navigate to the SET folder in your Matlab environment and then type set_game into the command line.
